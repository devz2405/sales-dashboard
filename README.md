# Sales Performance Dashboard (Power BI)

## Overview

This repository contains a data analytics project focused on analyzing sales performance using **Power BI**. The project uses a raw CSV dataset (1,000 records) to explore sales, orders, revenue, and profit trends across regions, product categories, and time.

The primary objective was to practice data cleaning, modeling, DAX calculations, and dashboard design while deriving clear, business-oriented insights.

## Dataset

* **Source:** Raw CSV file (included in the repository)
* **Size:** 1,000 rows
* **Key Fields:** Order Date, Region, Category, Product, Quantity, Sales, Profit, Order ID
* **Notes:** The dataset contains minor inconsistencies, handled during preprocessing in Power BI.

## Key Features

* **Dynamic KPIs:** Total Orders, Total Revenue, Total Profit
* **Sales Analysis:**

  * Sales by region
  * Revenue and quantity by product
  * Top 5 products by order count
* **Order Patterns:**

  * Regional order distribution
  * Category-based filtering
* **Profit Insights:**

  * Year-wise profit trends by category and product
  * Profit forecasting using time-series visuals
* **Interactivity:**

  * Slicers for category and date range
  * Cross-filtering across visuals

## Tools & Skills Used

* **Power BI** (Data modeling, DAX, dashboard design)
* **DAX** (KPIs, aggregations, time-based metrics)
* **Data Analysis Concepts** (EDA, trend analysis, KPI reporting)
* **Data Visualization** (Bar charts, line charts, pie charts, forecasts)

## Key Insights

* Identification of top-performing products and regions
* Clear comparison of regional sales and order volume
* Visibility into profit fluctuations over time
* Early indicators of growth opportunities through trend analysis

## Business Questions Answered

* Which regions and products contribute most to revenue and profit?
* What are the top-selling and most frequently ordered products?
* How do sales and profit trends evolve over time?
* Are there observable patterns that indicate future growth or decline?

## Project Scope

This project was completed during my **initial learning phase of data analytics** and is intended to demonstrate foundational skills in:

* Translating raw data into insights
* Building clean, interpretable dashboards
* Communicating results visually for stakeholders

## Repository Contents

* Raw sales CSV dataset
* Power BI dashboard file (.pbix)
* Dashboard screenshots
